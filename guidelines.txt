This file aims to give guidelines and information about how the project should be developed.

Technology:
    The project is using angular 18 with tailwindcss.

Structure:
    The components composing the app are standalone with inline style and inline templates.

Code guidelines:
Use Signals for:

Component state management
Computed values
Template bindings
Simple reactivity


Keep using RxJS for:

HTTP requests
Complex async operations
Event handling
Data streaming
Time-based operations
Error handling with retries
Combining multiple data sources

all the code you write will follow concepts of dumb and smart components.

Style:
    The project should follow the graphic chart provided in the tailwind.config.js file.
    Simple html elements such as buttons, input should be customized with animation to look modern.
    The use of gradients is strongly recommended.
